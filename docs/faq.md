# FAQ

## What purpose does SafePass serve?

SafePass exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.

**Emailing passwords is inherently insecure.** The greatest risks include:

* Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc...
* Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entitities.
* Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives
* Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..

The same risks persist when sending passwords via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, Chat etc...  The data can and is often perpetual and out of your control.

**By using SafePass, you bypass all of this.**

For each password posted to SafePass, **a unique URL is generated that only you will know**. Additionally, **passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed**. Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.

If that sounds interesting to you, [try it out](/) or see our other [Frequently Asked Questions](/pages/faq).

## Trust is a concern. Why should I use SafePass?

And rightfully so. All good security begins with healthy skepticism of all involved components.

SafePass exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords. It avoids having passwords exist in email archives in perpetuity. It does not exist as a end-all security solution.

**SafePass is opensource so the source can be publicly reviewed and can alternatively be run internally in your organization.**

**Passwords are entirely deleted from the database once they expire.** Additionally, random URL tokens are generated on the fly and passwords are posted without context (what they go to).

*A note for those with an interest in extreme security:* there is no way I can reliably prove that the opensource code is the same that runs on [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com/) (this is true for all sites in reality). The only thing I can provide in this respect is my public reputation on [Github](https://github.com/pglombardo), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterlombardo/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pglombardo) and [my blog](https://the0x00.dev). If this is a concern for you, feel free to review the code, post any questions that you may have and consider running it internally at your organization instead.

## Are there other ways I can access SafePass outside of a browser?

Absolutely.  SafePass has a fair number of applications and command line utilities that interface with pwpush.com or alternatively privately run instances.  See our [Tools & Applications](/pages/tools) page for more details.

## Can I automate my password distribution?

Yes - many users utilize either Slack or the command line to push and distribute passwords.  See our [Tools & Applications](/pages/tools) page for more details.

## How many requests can I send to SafePass?

There are no limits currently and I have no intention of adding any.  To minimally assure site stability, SafePass is configured with a rate limiter by default.

## How can I run my own version for my organization?

See our [Installation documentation](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher#-run-your-own-instance) for more details.

## Are there any licensing restrictions for me, my company or my organization?

The source code is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and that pretty much defines any and all limitations. There are quite a few rebranded & redesigned clone sites of SafePass and I welcome them all.

## Can I use SafePass in my talk/presentation/conference?

Absolutely.  Sending me a link to the talk/presentation/conference would be appreciated so I could share it on Twitter.

## Could you add a specific feature for my organization?

Very likely.  I love to hear all ideas & feedback. If you have any, please submit them to the [Github repository](https://github.com/pglombardo/SafePass) and I will respond as soon as possible.

## How do you make money?

I don't. This is just a project that I work on in my spare time built for the community. Monthly costs are $34/month for Heroku hosting and any time/effort that I've put in or will put in developing the tool is voluntary/donated.

I've thought about moving the site to a Digital Ocean droplet but Heroku just makes it so easy. No configuring Apache/nginx, deploy scripts, monitoring services etc...

**2021 Update**:  The [traffic has grown](https://twitter.com/pwpush/status/1390407791941201927) to an amount where 1 Heroku dyno no longer is sufficient. 2x professional dynos and the postgres add-on now has the project up to $59/month.   Longer term I need to find a way to lower costs - maybe an eventual migrate to Digital Ocean which has [much better performance](https://twitter.com/pwpush/status/1376194351605383172)...
