# Tools & Applications

Using the JSON API, various tools exist to interface with PWSend to automate password distribution.

We have no limits on how many passwords you can push (and have no intentions of adding limits) but we do have a rate limiter so the site doesn't get taken down by bad scripts or bad actors.  Limit your tools to maximum 1 password every few seconds and you should be fine.

# Slack

We don't have an official Slack application but it's fairly simple to add a custom slash command: [Slack: How to Add a Custom Slash Command](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/wiki/PasswordPusher-&-Slack:-Custom-Slash-Command)

## Raw API

This API allows you to interface with PWSend via JSON.  This can be utilized by existing utilities such as curl, wget or even javascript.  See the examples below for some ideas.

* [The PWSend JSON API](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/wiki/Password-API)

### Examples

#### Curl

```
curl -X POST --data "password[payload]=mypassword&password[expire_after_days]=2&password[expire_after_views]=10" https://pwpush.com/p.json
```

#### Browser JS Console

You can test this in your browsers' Javascript console by going to the front page of PWSend and enter:

```
$.post('https://pwpush.com/p.json',
         { 'password[payload]': 'mypassword', 'password[expire_after_days]': '2',
           'password[expire_after_views]': '10' }, 
           function(data) { alert(data.url_token) } )
```
